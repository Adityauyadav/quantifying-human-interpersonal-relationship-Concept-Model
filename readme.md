# A Mathematical Model to Quantify Interpersonal relation - A Concept.

## 🌱 Why This Exists

This project started with a simple but powerful thought I had one day:

> “What if we could quantify any human relationship — whether it’s love, friendship, or even a casual acquaintance — using a common mathematical model?”

I kept thinking about how emotions, effort, time, and shared experiences shape our bonds — and wondered if there’s a way to **generalize** that. Not to reduce the beauty of human connection, but to **understand it better** — maybe even use it in psychology, mental health, or AI-human systems.

So I started building this formula.

## ✨ What This Is

This repository contains a **conceptual whitepaper** I wrote — where I’ve proposed a high-level framework for modeling the strength of human relationships. It’s still evolving and very much a **work-in-progress**. I'm researching ways to ground it more deeply in data, psychology, and computational models.

## 🤝 Why I’m Sharing It

I’m putting this out here to:

- Make the idea public and timestamped  
- Invite feedback, critique, and conversation  
- Connect with anyone curious about this space  
- Maybe even find collaborators who can help take this further  

If you're into **psychology, AI, computational sociology, emotional modeling**, or just curious about human connection — I’d love to hear your thoughts.

## 🚧 What’s Next

- Exploring real-world data to test this model
- Reading literature from psychology, affective computing, and behavioral sciences
- Building possible simulations or visualizations around the concept
- Understanding where this model falls short — and how to improve it

## 📬 Open to Collaboration

If you resonate with this idea or have suggestions, thoughts, papers, or even criticism — I’d genuinely appreciate hearing from you. This is an open journey, and I’d love to build with others.
